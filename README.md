Sorting Animations

My attempt at recreating something similar to the classic sorting animations: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg)
I still need to work out a solution to the sound component of the project, but the animation side is done.

Current algorithms done:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Quick Sort (Inplace, Non-randomized pivot)
  - Shell Sort
